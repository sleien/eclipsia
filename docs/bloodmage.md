### System Explanation
**Standard Spellcasting:**  
Up to the listed number of spells per spell level can be cast at the standard HP cost, which is equal to the character's level times the spell's level.

**Beyond the Limit:**  
Casting spells beyond these limits costs additional hit points. The multiplier indicates how much more it costs. For example, at 1st level, casting a third 1st-level spell would cost twice the normal amount of hit points.

The "deep wound" damage applies before the multiplier cost. The multiplier is added again, if the limit is surpased again.
